In a Maven project, the **`target/` folder** is automatically created when you build the project (e.g., by running `mvn package`, `mvn install`, or `mvn compile`). This directory holds all the **build output** — essentially, everything Maven generates during the build process.

### Contents of the `target/` folder

Here are the most common files and subdirectories inside `target/`:

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **`classes/`** | Contains compiled `.class` files from your project's Java source code (`src/main/java`). |
| **`test-classes/`** | Contains compiled `.class` files from your test code (`src/test/java`). |
| **`[project-name].jar` / `.war` / `.ear`** | The final packaged artifact (depending on your project type — JAR, WAR, or EAR file). This is what gets deployed. |
| **`generated-sources/`** | Stores source code generated by Maven plugins (e.g., JAXB or annotation processors). |
| **`surefire-reports/`** | Contains test reports generated by the Maven Surefire Plugin after running unit tests. |
| **`maven-status/`** | Stores status and metadata used internally by Maven to track builds. |
| **`[project-name].original`** | Sometimes created to preserve the original artifact before shading or other transformations. |
| **Temporary files** | You may also find log files, temporary archives, or plugin-generated artifacts, depending on the plugins used.

### Example structure:
```
target/
├── classes/
├── test-classes/
├── generated-sources/
├── surefire-reports/
├── my-app-1.0.jar
├── maven-status/
```

### When to clean it:
You can clean the `target/` directory with:
```bash
mvn clean
```
This removes everything inside `target/`, forcing Maven to do a fresh build next time.
