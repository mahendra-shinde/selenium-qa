# Introduction to Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It is highly extensible with a vast library of plugins to support various tools and platforms.

## Key Features of Jenkins
- Open-source and free to use.
- Supports distributed builds across multiple machines.
- Extensible with a large plugin ecosystem.
- Easy integration with version control systems like Git.
- Provides a web-based interface for configuration and monitoring.
